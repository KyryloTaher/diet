# diet

This repository contains a simple Tkinter-based application for generating optimized diets from the USDA database.

## Usage
Run `python diet_app.py` and fill in the required fields. The application now stores the last entered values in `last_setup.json` and reloads them on startup so you do not need to re-enter data each time.
